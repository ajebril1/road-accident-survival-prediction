    "Hello, This is my Data mining project 2. Today, we will be doing analysis and creating a classification model using the Road Accident Survival Dataset. Road accidents are a huge concern worldwide, leading to many injuries and fatalities every year. Having the ability to be able to predict the survival outcome of an individual involved in a road accident based on several factors can enhance the emergency response strategies, improving the safety measures of roads, and assist in the decisions made in the medical field.

Some of the questions we aim to answer include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which factors are most important in determining the survival outcome of an individual involved in a road accident?\n",
    "- Can we identify any patterns or trends in the data that may help us make more informed decisions when planning road safety measures?\n",
